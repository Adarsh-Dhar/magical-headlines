// This script demonstrates how to generate a new Arweave wallet/keyfile using Node.js.
// You'll need to have the 'arweave' package installed: npm install arweave

// Import the filesystem module to save the keyfile and the Arweave library.
import Arweave from 'arweave';

// --- Configuration ---
// It's good practice to initialize Arweave. You can point to a specific gateway
// or use the default settings.

        // Anyone with access to this file can control your wallet and its funds.
